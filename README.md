# Truffle React
## In this example we will build a supply chain example with truffle 
### To begin this project we make a folder and navigate to that folder by typing `cd <foldername>`. Once we navigate to that folder we type this command in the terminal `npx truffle unbox react` to begin the setup of the full application.
